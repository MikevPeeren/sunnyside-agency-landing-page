## My process

I have developed using a Mobile First approach. First I implemented the layout before I added all the content. When this was finished I made it responsive so Desktop and Mobile work nicely. After this I added the hover states and finally finished with the NavBar.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I have learned more about Mobile First design approach. I have also learned more about positioning in CSS in order for components to render properly.
